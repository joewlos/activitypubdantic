### Validate and Interact with ActivityPub JSON

## What Is ActivityPubdantic?

**ActivityPubdantic** is a suite of tools for validating ActivityPub JSON and constructing consistent representations of ActivityPub notifications and content. [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) models enable the validation logic and can be imported for use in custom-coded classes or FastAPI routes.

## Why Does ActivityPub JSON Require Validation?

[ActivityPub](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/) is a protocol for decentralized social networking. It defines client-to-server and server-to-server interactions and relies on [ActivityStreams](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-orderedcollection) for its vocabulary. Many of the protocol's definitions are purposefully unrestrictive, giving developers the freedom to implement only the features relevant to their products or to adjust to meet their particular requirements.

However, that flexibility presents challenges for assessing data validity and simplifying developers' code. **ActivityPubdantic** helps solve those challenges by using ActivityPub's "type" field to identify proper checks for other fields and standardize their structures. [Examples](#examples) are available in the sections below.

[Mastodon](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/spec/activitypub/) supports ActivityPub, and Meta's [Threads](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/threads-an-instagram-app/id6446901002) app plans to conform to the protocol sometime in the [near future](https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/05/adam-mosseri-says-metas-threads-app-wont-have-activitypub-support-at-launch/). **ActivityPubdantic** includes a test suite, which uses examples from ActivityPub, ActivityStreams, and Mastodon to test its parsing and validation. As Threads and other platforms implement ActivityPub, those tests (and more broadly, this package) will be updated to stay current.

## Examples

The following examples include simple use cases and code snippets for **ActivityPubdantic**. For a more thorough listing of **ActivityPubdantic's** classes, functions, and models, check out its [documentation](https://www.joewlos.com/activitypubdantic/).

### Parsing Activity, Collection, Link, and Object JSON

`Activities`, `Collections`, `Links`, and `Objects` are the core concepts around which ActivityPub and ActivityStreams are built. By reducing their complexity and standardizing their representation, **ActivityPubdantic** helps resolve potential pain points for developers.

ActivityPub's protocol includes an [example](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#client-to-server-interactions) of a `Like` activity. The example's `to` field is a list, while its `cc` field is a string. Both formats are valid, but they require slightly different handling in subsequent lines of code. To resolve that difference, after validating this JSON, **ActivityPubdantic** rewrites it, so those fields are always presented as lists of dictionaries.

```python
import activitypubdantic as ap
example_json = {
  "@context": ["https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
               {"@language": "en"}],
  "type": "Like",
  "actor": "https://dustycloud.org/chris/",
  "name": "Chris liked 'Minimal ActivityPub update client'",
  "object": "https://rhiaro.co.uk/2016/05/minimal-activitypub",
  "to": ["https://rhiaro.co.uk/#amy",
         "https://dustycloud.org/followers",
         "https://rhiaro.co.uk/followers/"],
  "cc": "https://e14n.com/evan"
}
output_class = ap.get_class(example_json)  # Class is determined by "type" field
output_json = output_class.json()
print(output_json)  # See JSON below
```

`get_class()` reads the `example_json` and uses its type to select the applicable Pydantic model. It then uses Pydantic validators for each field to assert they comply with the protocol and then restructure them.

The `output_json` is longer and, at first glance, more complex. But because it contains types for each item in its fields and it standardizes the structures of similar fields – like `to` and `cc` – it is more descriptive and easier to consistently manipulate.

```json
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
    {
      "@language": "en"
    }
  ],
  "type": "Like",
  "name": "Chris liked 'Minimal ActivityPub update client'",
  "to": [
    {
      "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
      "type": "Object",
      "id": "https://rhiaro.co.uk/#amy"
    },
    {
      "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
      "type": "Object",
      "id": "https://dustycloud.org/followers"
    },
    {
      "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
      "type": "Object",
      "id": "https://rhiaro.co.uk/followers/"
    }
  ],
  "cc": [
    {
      "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
      "type": "Object",
      "id": "https://e14n.com/evan"
    }
  ],
  "actor": [
    {
      "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
      "type": "Object",
      "id": "https://dustycloud.org/chris/"
    }
  ],
  "object": {
    "@context": "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
    "type": "Object",
    "id": "https://rhiaro.co.uk/2016/05/minimal-activitypub"
  }
}
```

However, not every project requires this degree of granularity. For example, some servers may already have logic that ignores additional fields and only iterates through `id` URLs in the JSON.

```python
short_output_json = output_class.json(verbose=False)  # Use the verbosity flag
print(short_output_json)  # See JSON below
```

A verbosity flag shortens the output, retaining consistency but eliminating unneeded data for simpler implementations.

```json
{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
    {
      "@language": "en"
    }
  ],
  "type": "Like",
  "name": "Chris liked 'Minimal ActivityPub update client'",
  "to": [
    "https://rhiaro.co.uk/#amy",
    "https://dustycloud.org/followers",
    "https://rhiaro.co.uk/followers/"
  ],
  "cc": ["https://e14n.com/evan"],
  "actor": ["https://dustycloud.org/chris/"],
  "object": "https://rhiaro.co.uk/2016/05/minimal-activitypub"
}
```

### Validating FastAPI Request Bodies

[FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) uses Pydantic models to validate [request bodies](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/body/). After importing **ActivityPubdantic** models directly, developers can automatically validate requests and then use the `get_class_from_model()` function to smoothly interact with the ActivityPub JSON.

In the following example, when the same `Like` activity is sent in the POST request to `/outbox`, the request body is validated by FastAPI, loaded into an **ActivityPubdantic** class to produce clean JSON, and used to specify a location in the response header, per the ActivityPub [documentation](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#client-to-server-interactions) for client-to-server interactions.

```python
import activitypubdantic as ap
from activitypubdantic.models import *
from fastapi import FastAPI, Response

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/outbox", status_code=201)
async def outbox(activity: ActivityModel, response: Response):
    activity_class = ap.get_class_from_model(activity)
    print(activity_class.json())  # Save this JSON in the database
    response.headers["Location"] = "https://example.com/{0}/{1}".format(
        activity_class.type.lower(),  # Use the type to help generate the returned location
        1,  # ID should come from the database
    )
    return {"message": "Submitted to Outbox"}
```
